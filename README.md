# Custom Synastry Calculator
## Overview
Input two **custom** natal charts and get their synastry report, with a list of all aspects as well as each planet's total stats - green for positive and red for negative!
Wowza!

### Notes
* In the documentation of AspectCalculator, "reversed aspect" is used to describe an aspect which crosses the 0 degree point of the zodiac wheel, since this type of aspect needs a "reversed" algorithm in order to be calculated correctly.
* "Birth chart" and "natal chart" mean the same thing and are used interchangeably.
* Please take the stats with a grain of salt, the overall compatibility between two people in astrology cannot realistically be calculated based on numbers!
* **Astrology isn't real, but it's fun!**
